/**
Creates a debounced function that delays execution until `wait` milliseconds have passed since its last invocation.

Set the `immediate` option to `true` to execute the function immediately at the start of the `wait` interval, preventing issues such as double-clicks on a button.

The returned function has the following methods:

- `.clear()` cancels any scheduled executions.
- `.flush()` if an execution is scheduled then it will be immediately executed and the timer will be cleared.
- `.trigger()` executes the function immediately and clears the timer if it was previously set.
- `.isDebouncing()` checks if the debounce delay is still active.
